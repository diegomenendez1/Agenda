# Cortex AI Assistant - Walkthrough

Welcome to your new **Cortex AI Assistant**! This guide will help you navigate the new features and premium interface designed to supercharge your productivity and team orchestration.

## 1. The "Smart Capture" Experience

At the heart of Cortex is the new **Smart Input** at the top of your Inbox.

*   **Context Aware**: Paste an email, a meeting coordination message, or a quick thought. Cortex acts as your dumping ground.
*   **Visual Feedback**: Watch the interface glow as it recognizes your input context.
*   **Process Later**: Items land in your Inbox with an inferred source (Email loop icon vs User icon), ready for you to "Process" into actionable tasks or notes.

## 2. Team Orchestration Board

Navigate to the **Team Board** via the sidebar loop icon.

*   **Kanban View**: Visualize your team's velocity across `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Review`, and `Done`.
*   **Drag & Drop**: Effortlessly move tasks between stages.
*   **Team Visibility**: See who is working on what with avatar indicators on every card.

## 3. Premium Neural Interface

Enjoy a workspace designed for focus:

*   **Deep Space Theme**: A calming, dark violet aesthetic reduced eye strain and looks professional.
*   **Glassmorphism**: Panels float with subtle blurs, adding depth without clutter.
*   **Micro-interactions**: Hover over tasks, buttons, and inputs to feel the responsiveness of the application.

## 4. Intelligent Task Management

*   **Priority System**: New `Critical`, `Urgent`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, and `Auto` priorities help you focus on what matters.
*   **My Focus**: The revamped Tasks view sorts your day automatically by Priority and Status.

## Next Steps

*   **AI Integration**: The current version simulates AI processing. Future updates will connect this to actual LLMs for auto-summarization and delegation.
*   **Team Invites**: Invite your real team members to collaborate on the board.
