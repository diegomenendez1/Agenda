# Intelligent Assistant - Implementation Plan

## Objective
Transform the existing "Volatile-Event" agenda into a high-end **Intelligent AI Assistant** that organizes tasks, parses complex inputs (emails), and orchestrates team workflows.

## 1. Core Architecture & Data Model Updates
We need to expand the data model to support "Intelligence" and "Teams".

### New ENTITIES (Types)
- **UserProfile**: `{ id, name, role, skills/context }` - Defines who the assistant is helping.
- **TeamMember**: `{ id, name, avatar, role }` - For delegation.
- **Task**:
  - `priority`: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'auto' (AI detected)
  - `status`: 'backlog' | 'todo' | 'in_progress' | 'review' | 'done'
  - `source`: 'manual' | 'email' | 'voice'
  - `smartAnalysis`: `{ originalText, confidence, reasoning }` - Stores AI processing metadata.
  - `assigneeId`: Link to TeamMember.

## 2. UI/UX "Premium" Overhaul
The interface must feel alive and "Assistive", not passive.
- **Aesthetic**: Deep space/midnight theme with "Glassmorphism" (translucent panels).
- **Typography**: Inter (Clean, legible).
- **Motion**: Micro-interactions when completing tasks or switching views.

## 3. Key Features Implementation

### A. The "Neural" Input (Smart Capture)
A central command center that is more than a text box.
- Accepts massive text blocks (emails).
- *Simulation*: Visual "Processing..." state where it highlights dates, names, and action items before converting them to tasks.

### B. Dynamic Task Prioritization
- Tasks are sorted not just by date but by `impact` and `urgency`.
- Visual cues: Heatmap colors for high-priority items.

### C. Team Orchestration (Kanban)
- A Board view with columns: `Backlog` -> `In Progress` -> `Review` -> `Done`.
- Drag-and-drop interface (using accessible HTML5 D&D or libraries if available, but likely custom for speed).
- User avatars on tasks to show ownership.

## 4. Workflows

### Scenario 1: The "Email Dump"
1. User pastes a 500-word email thread into "Inbox".
2. System helps identify: "Action required by [User Role]".
3. System extracts the single core task.

### Scenario 2: Team Sync
1. Leader opens "Team Board".
2. Moves a task from "Backlog" to "In Progress".
3. Assigns it to "Sarah".

## Technical Steps
1.  **Refactor `src/core/types.ts`**: Add new fields.
2.  **Update `src/core/store.ts`**: Add actions for `assignTask`, `updateStatus`.
3.  **Design System Update**: Refine `index.css` for the Premium look.
4.  **Build Components**:
    - `SmartInput.tsx`: The parsing interface.
    - `KanbanBoard.tsx`: The team view.
    - `UserProfile.tsx`: Context settings.
